## Introduction 

* One to One Tutor and student session management
United Tutoring is an online platform for one-to-one tutoring. This online platform caters to two
types of users: tutors who impart knowledge and students who seek knowledge. Students can use
this platform to interact with registered tutors and get all their questions answered when they are
having difficulty understanding a concept or want to learn something new. Besides improving their
overall understanding of a subject or topic, this also assists them in trying out and learning
something new. A user can be both a tutor as well as a student.

* Tutors must create an account and list their skills and experience in their expertise. Registered
students can search by skill and obtain a list of tutors who specialize in that subject. Students can
then go to each tutor's profile and arrange an appointment with whichever tutor appears to be
pertinent to their question. Moreover, tutors will be able to enter their available dates and time
range, which will subsequently be transformed into one-hour slots. A real-time schedule of tutors'
slots will be available for students, and they will be able to schedule accordingly. When a student
requests a booking, it appears on the tutor's my booking requests page. A link to a Zoom meeting
will be sent to both participants if the tutor approves the booking request. If the tutor rejects the
request, the student will receive an email notifying them of the rejection. Every hour, a Cronjob
runs to update the status of sessions that have expired. In addition, tutors can view their entered
availabilities and all requests, including accepted, rejected, and pending requests.
